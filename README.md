# Recommendation-System
## Analyzing User 2's Movie Preferences
* The analysis starts by examining user 2's movie-watching behavior.
* A histogram of user 2's movie ratings is plotted using seaborn.
* The top-rated movies of user 2 (rated 5.0) are identified along with their genres.
## Finding Similar Users
* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distances are utilized to identify users with similar movie preferences to user 2.
* A pivot table is created to represent user ratings for movies.
* Cosine similarity scores are calculated to find similar users.
* Euclidean distances are also calculated, although there may be issues in printing the output.
## Movie Recommendations for User 2
* Recommendations are made based on the preferences of similar users.
* Top-rated movies from similar users are considered for recommendation.
* Movies already watched by user 2 are excluded from the recommendation list.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into user 2's movie preferences and suggests relevant movies based on similarity with other users. By analyzing user behavior and applying recommendation algorithms, personalized movie recommendations can be generated effectively.
